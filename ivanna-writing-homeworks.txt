About honour, trust and kindness.
I defenetly disagree with this opinion. A people always will appreciate honour and trust. 
Because It doesn't matter what is your social status because always will be people on the same level as your. And you can not look successful if your have not any humans' appreciated chacteristics. 
If we start talk about honour and trust, a would ask you the question. How man can be a leader without honour? And how this man can manage people that, let's say, working for him(не уверен там ли я вставил "let's say" с запятыми). Man must to be a fair man to get respect in any industry and in any field of activity. 

In the world there are many persons who never had and will never will have such humans' qualities such a kindness. But they are exceptions. Let me show you an example. Steve Jobs even after his funeral continue to be an icon of Apple Inc. and he gave us such a huge contribution in design, marketing and brought share of perfectionism in software development. Can we said that he was kindness person? Maybe no. But we respect him anyway. But most of the popular persons in history without kindness was only repressors and tyrants. Maybe someone even respect such a persons, but this happends because aggression lying in human nature.

We must be realistic. Some people are exceptions. That means they can dominate among ordinary people.(в след. предл. незнаю как знаки перпинания с вопросом согласовать.) But ask yourself: With whom people you will fill better? 
So, from my point of view, human nature contain many bad quilities recorded in our genotype, and real power is ability to overcome them.

And in additional It would be remiss for me do not talk about perspective and changelist of our society. And as I write before, human nature contain default humans' characteristics and one of them is fear of death. Nothing can be powerful then this fear. And most of human after Second Wide World change his mind. After this war is happened people become more sensitive to kindness. Because everyone want to live in the peice. That when kindness become very powerful humans' quality.
